# NLP Review Scorer

**Disclamer: This is only a toy. You should seriously treat your rebuttal despite the what scores are give below. Wish you good luck for your paper submission!**

I know some of you are thinking about how to conver my review to numerical score.
Yes, the time has come.

In this notebook, you will be able to **convert your review to overall score (hopefully in range 1~5) as well as reviewer confidence.**

**As the notebook will run under YOUR CONTROL, please rest assured that your review won't be recorded in any form and I have no access to it.**

## Quick introduction
The model is trained on 3K real reviews from [PeerRead dataset](https://github.com/allenai/PeerRead) as well as in-house collected reviews for training. 
The implementation was based on `run_classifier.py` in [BERT repository](https://github.com/google-research/bert) with slight modifications.

Included venue: ACL, EMNLP, CoNLL, NAACL, COLING, ICLR (scores are scaled to 1~5)

**As the review data is rather private, I won't be able to release them.**

**************REVIEW***********
The paper was rather bad that I don't want to see it again. 
The idea was trivial and the evaluations are not convincing to me at all. 
We should reject this paper or I won't review for this venue in the future,
